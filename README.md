Extension Versions
`datadaddy_ccpa` is our first attempt at creating an extension and contains data broker email generation functionality. This is what we demoed at our midsemester presentation.
`datadaddy_hardcode` is our version of the extension which hardcodes the mapping between domains a user is on to that domain's privacy policy and contact information. This is what we demoed at for our PRC demo presentation.
`datadaddy_react` is our final version which leverages react and node to import modules.
